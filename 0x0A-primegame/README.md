# Prime Game

This Python module provides a solution for the Prime Game question. The game is played by two players, Maria and Ben, over multiple rounds. Each round is defined by a positive integer `n`, and the players take turns choosing prime numbers from the set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`. The chosen prime number and its multiples are then removed from the set. The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
